## Research

I am a member of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, in the Soft Matter group headed by Prof. Michael E. Cates. 

I am interested in the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of active matter systems, including self-propelled particles and living cells. My main focus is active gels theories and specifically understanding their departure from equlibrium and the breakage of time-reversal-symmetry.

Other interests: Statistical mechanics of complex charged fluids, electrostatics of ionic solutions, ionic specific effects and their interplay with ion-ion correlations
